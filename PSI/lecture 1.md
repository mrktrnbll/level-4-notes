### Computing Legislation

### Computing Ethics
Needed because
- beyond intro stage, it is in every day life the permutation phase

**routine ethics** - computing ethics is no difference from other ethics
**Cultural relativism** - cultures define right and wrong and because computing is international it is not possible to define?
Moor says nah ^
underestimates unique nature of computing ethics and underestimates our core human values

shared values - humans prefer life over death, happy over sad/pain etc. means cultural relativism is bull.
**logical malleability, invisibilty factor, information enriching**
computers can grammatically do anything, they can do things that no person could understand and that will cause issue, they start by enabling domains and task and then they are integrated and change the task to the point that the former task can no longer be done

**many any???**

# Situational Impairment
What is situational impairment:
- when the context of user creates blocker to interact with device

**Provide input** or **perceive output**

Using **social context** in mobile devices:
You walk into a room to talk with someone, they are currently speaking but there is no one in the room with them.
You infer they are on a call and action not speak until they address you.

With context we can design real time things that allow mobiles to adjust based on this social context.
**Gather -> Inference -> Action/Adapt**
